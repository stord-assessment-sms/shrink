# Benchmarking

Local benchmarks have been performed using [oha](https://github.com/hatoo/oha/),
a descendent of [rakyll/hey](https://github.com/rakyll/hey) written in ðŸ¦€ Rust.

## Tool Installation

If you've followed the Setup instructions using `mise` with the experimental
`cargo-binstall` support enabled, `oha` should automatically be in your `PATH`.

Otherwise:

```bash
brew install oha
```

## Running Tests

Exercising the new-link form can be performed with `oha`:

```bash
# -z is duration but does not seem to have a long-form flag
oha -z 30s "http://localhost:4001/"
```

Once you've shortened a link and obtained the URL, you can exercise that path as well:

```bash
# -z is duration but does not seem to have a long-form flag
# redirects must be disabled or else load-tests will impact the destination URL
oha --redirect 0 -z 30s "http://localhost:4001/g4ytqz"
```

### Example Results

`oha` has a rather satisfying realtime view during stress tests which looks like this:

When complete, it generates a report like so:

_These results taken from my machine running against a `MIX_ENV=prod` release
running via Docker-Compose._

## Statistics by Route

All measurements were worst-of-3 of 30-second test runs taken on:

- 16" MacBook Pro (2023)
- M2 Max (ARM)
- 64 GB
- MacOS 14.4.1
- Plugged into mains power
- Chassis comfortably cool to touch

Docker Desktop 4.28.0 VM had the following resource allocations:

- CPU Limit: 12
- Memory Limit: 7.9GB
- Swap: 1GB
- Virtual Disk Limit: 64GB

The application was deployed according to the Docker-Compose instructions and
configuration, so using a compiled release with `MIX_ENV=prod`.
The BEAM container was restarted between runs, but PostgreSQL was not.
The `links` table had 3 rows, `link_visits` had 3 rows.
